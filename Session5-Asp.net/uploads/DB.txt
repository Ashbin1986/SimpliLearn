Atomicity: A transaction is a single unit of operation. You either execute it entirely or do not execute it at all. 
There cannot be partial execution.

Consistency: Once the transaction is executed, it should move from one consistent state to another.

Isolation: Transaction should be executed in isolation from other transactions (no Locks).
 During concurrent transaction execution, intermediate transaction results from simultaneously executed transactions
 should not be made available to each other. (Level 0,1,2,3)


Durability: Â· After successful completion of a transaction, the changes in the database should persist. 
Even in the case of system failures.
